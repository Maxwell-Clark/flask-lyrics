madlib = f"There are many {adj1} ways to choose a/an {noun1} to read. \
 First, you could ask for recommendations from your friends and {plural_noun1}. \
 Just don't ask Aunt {female_in_room} - she only reads {adj2} books with {article_of_clothing}-\
 ripping goddesses on the cover. If your friends and family are no help, try checking out the {noun2}\
 Review in The {city} Times. If the {plural_noun2} featured there are too {adj3} \
 for your taste, try something a little more low-{part_of_body}, like {letter_of_alphabet}:\
 The {celebrity} Magazine, or {plural_noun3} Magazine. You could also choose a book the \
 {adj4} - fashioned way. Head in to your local library or {place} and browse the shelves until something\
 catches your {part_of_body2}. Or, you could save yourself with a whole lot of {adj5} trouble\
 and log on to {website}, the {adj6} new website to {verb} for books! \
 With all the time you'll save not having to search for {plural_noun4}, you can read {number} more books!"
